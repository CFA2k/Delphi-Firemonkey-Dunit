#TreeView Demo Project

This Folder contains simple projects to demonstrate the use of TreeViews with TFMXImageList.

The DUnit testing GUI made use of the VCL TreeView which had different functionality to the FireMonkey 
TreeView.

We developed two Libraries to extend the ListBox and Tree View to meet requirement 

The PowerPoint Slides in the top directory give some usage notes. 

The files FMXListBoxLib and FMXTreeViewLib contain extensions to FireMonkey componants required to interface with TFMXImageList and the DUnit Gui Code.
The Style File StylesForDUnitMobileForm contains the related style changes.
